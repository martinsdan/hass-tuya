The Tuya Home Assistant integration is developed for controlling **Powered by Tuya (PBT)** devices using the [tuya-iot-python-sdk](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-iot-python-sdk?_source=df9bd859d17e7610d5b9df34d38a83e9) (a python version of [Tuya Open API](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/cloud/?_source=6c7c0e6d9fc9ac8296e1a48954e1d0e4)), and maintained by the official Tuya Developer Team and Home Assistant Community.
